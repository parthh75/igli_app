      benefits:
          "\n\nThere are numerous reasons to register a trademark, but the majority of them are required for all businesses and ambitious entrepreneurs because it serves as a valuable asset. Obtaining a trademark registration and utilizing the services has numerous advantages. Here are a few benefits."
          "\n\nIntellectual Property Protection:-"
          "\n\nThe legal protection provided by trademark registration is against the misuse or copying of the companyâ€™s name or registered logo. The trademark owner acquires legal ownership of the trademark, which can be enforced in any court. When a trademark is registered, the owner gains nationwide possession of the mark"
          "\n\nA trademark registration serves as a formal notice that the trademark has already been registered."
          "\n\nPowerful Deterrent:-"
          "\n\nA trademark owner obtains the ability to publicly display his or her brand as a registered trademark, alerting others and eliminating the defense of innocent infringement. Once a trademark is registered, it will appear in search reports, preventing other applicants from pursuing the registration of the same or similar mark."
          "\n\nIf you are the first to file a trademark, the National Trademark Office in New Delhi will reject to register any trademark that appears to be confusingly similar to another trademark."
          "\n\nLegal Remedies:-"
          "\n\nThe owner of a trademark can recover up to triple damages from the offender if the trademark is registered in India. The owner is presumed to be the rightful owner of the trademark. When a trademark is registered, the owner gains the ability to sue anyone who is misusing the mark in any court. Unregistered trademarks, on the other hand, are subject to legal action.",
